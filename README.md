## How to run
- Clone the repository
- Run the following commands
```
$ sudo apt install ros-humble-joint-state-publisher ros-humble-robot-state-publisher ros-humble-cartographer ros-humble-cartographer-ros ros-humble-gazebo-plugins ros-humble-teleop-twist-keyboard  ros-humble-teleop-twist-joy ros-humble-xacro ros-humble-nav2* ros-humble-urdf

$ cd tortoisebot

$ colcon build

$ source install/setup.bash

# Run the next command in all terminals
$ export NUM_ROBOTS=3

# Run the following in different terminals
$ ros2 launch tortoisebot_description display.launch.py use_sim_time:=true

$ ros2 launch tortoisebot_slam cartographer.launch.py use_sim_time:=true

$ ros2 run tortoisebot_server map_merge
```

## Modifications to the existing Tortoisebot code

1. **Modification to Robot xacro  and Gazebo files:**
    - Addition of namespaces to all the links and joints
    <!-- - Remapping of topics to include  -->
2. **Modification to Launch files:**
    - `display.launch.py`
    - `state_publisher.launch.py`
    - `Gazebo.launch.py`
    - To generalize the application for any given number of robots, all the deployments are put in a for loop that runs for `NUM_ROBOTS` times
    - Remapped all the sensor ooutputs to comply with the namespaces

3. **Created a `tortoise_server` package:**
    - Created a `map_merge` node that takes individual submaps as input and merges them to create a more accurate estimation of the complete map



## Approach

1. **Spawing multiple robots in the environment:**
    - Environment variable `NUM_ROBOTS` is used to set the number of robots in the environment
    - Every bot has it's own cartographer node.
    - The maps published by each cartographer are available at `/tortoisebot_simple_i/map` where `i` denotes the index of the bot (0,1 or 2)
    - Status - Completed in ROS

2. **Map Merger:**
    - **Approach 1:** 
        - Directly overlay all the three maps after converting them to the world frame.
        - Status: Implemented in ROS
    - **Approach 2:**
        - The Occupancy grids generated by individual SLAM nodes are converted into images such that the obstacle boundaries are shown in black, unoccupied cells in white while unknown/ unexplored cells are shown in grey (here, the shade of grey used for unknown cells is closer to white for better feature extraction)
        - SIFT based image sticher is used to extract and match the features in various images that cover overlapping areas for better estimation of the final map.
        - Status: yet to be integrated with ROS
    
3. **Navigation:**
    - This task is currently replaced with manual control for testing
    - The robots are assigned navigation tasks based on the positions of other robots and explored map. The mentioned data is used to calculate a probabilty of the area being explored by other robots later in time. The tasks are reassigned when map is updated upon encounter.
    
4. **Robot Detection:**
    - In order to collaboratively manuever and map the given space, it is crucial that the robots can detect and communicate with one another
    - The detection can be done by using Computer Vision and visual markers like color or AruCo markers.

5. **Collaborative relative pose Estimation:**
    - Since we are not using any predefined location marker, the pose estimation using odometry will have a deviation increasing with time. In such a case, the relative position of a detected robot can be used to refine the localization estimations. 
    - One way to do this Estimation is **Collaborative Multi-Robot Monte Carlo Localization**. When the bots detect each other, they share the sensor data i.e. the map and the _beleif of_ other bot's relative postion. This information is used to correct the possible errors in both the systems.

# 1. Installation
## 1.1 Required Dependences: 
```
sudo apt install ros-humble-joint-state-publisher ros-humble-robot-state-publisher ros-humble-cartographer ros-humble-cartographer-ros ros-humble-gazebo-plugins ros-humble-teleop-twist-keyboard  ros-humble-teleop-twist-joy ros-humble-xacro ros-humble-nav2* ros-humble-urdf 

```
```
cd ~/your workscpace
colcon build
```
## 1.2 Clone this repo 
Make sure you clone the repo in your robot and your remote PC 
```
git clone -b ros2-humble https://github.com/rigbetellabs/tortoisebot.git
```
```
cd ~/your workscpace
colcon build
```
# 2. Setup

- Run bringup.launch.py to only spawn the robot
- Run autobringup.launch.py to spawn the robot with navigation and slam/localization
- Launch the files with use_sim_time:=False when working on real robot

### 2.1 Launching the robot

```
ros2 launch tortoisebot_bringup autobringup.launch.py use_sim_time:=True exploration:=True
```
- exploration:=False for passed a saved map to navigation

### 2.2 Launch files for reference
#### SLAM
- cartographer.launch.py
#### Navigation
- navigation.launch.py
#### Rviz
- rviz.launch.py
#### Gazebo
- gazebo.launch.py

### 2.3 Remote PC

While performing colcon build on remote-pc please add the below to ignore `ydlidar_sdk, ydlidar_ros2_driver, v4l2_camera` since lidar will not be connected to remote-pc.

```
colcon build --packages-ignore ydlidar_sdk ydlidar_ros2_driver v4l2_camera
```
